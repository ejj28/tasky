Tasky includes a process manager, CPU utilization monitor and a system information viewer.

#### As of August 2018, Tasky development has shifted from Visual Basic Express 2010 to Visual Studio 2017. Using Visual Basic Express 2010 or anything else older than Visual Studio 2017 is highly unrecommended due to possible compatibility issues.
